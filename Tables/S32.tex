The "Support from" variables differ in both surveys: the Arab Barometer survey asked whether respondents thought that a family member who was abused would be able to receive assistance from each of the actors, and our survey asked whether respondents would recommend a friend or family member who was abused to reach each of the actors. (2) The "Experienced violence" variable differs in both surveys: the Arab Barometer survey asked if in the last twelve months a female member of the household was abused by another member, and our survey asked whether, in the month before the COVID-19 pandemic, they heard of someone or themselves experienced being hit by a man.} \end{table}

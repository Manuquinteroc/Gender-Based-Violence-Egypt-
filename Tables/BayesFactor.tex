\justify {\footnotesize \textit{Notes:} We compute the Bayes Factor for each non-statistically coefficient at the 95\% 
          level in our main indexes when including all variables selected by the LASSO model. 
          The Bayes Factor compares under the null hypothesis the corresponding treatment indicator equal to $0$
          and under the alternative hypotesis distinct than $0$.} \end{table}
